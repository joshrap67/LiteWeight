        LiteWeight is a lightweight workout manager that allows for multiple workouts to be created and managed.\n\nDefault exercises are provided by
        the developer, and if desired you can add your own custom exercises to be used in any workout!
        All exercises can have a URL associated with it should you wish to be able to view a video on how to perform it while working out.
        You can also specify the most recent amount of weight for each exercise.\n\nAll data is saved locally on your phone in a database, and in the future functionality for cloud storage may become available.
