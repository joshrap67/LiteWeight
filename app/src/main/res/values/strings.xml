        LiteWeight is an open source lightweight workout manager that allows for multiple workouts to be created and managed. Workouts can be fixed in size either by weeks or sequential days, and can be cycled indefinitely with relevant statistics tracked.
        \n\nDefault exercises are provided by the developer, and, if desired, you can add your own custom exercises to be used in any workout!
        All exercises can have a URL associated with them should you wish to be able to view a video on how to perform one while working out.
        You can also set the most recent amount of weight for specific exercises and this weight will carry over to all your workouts.\n\nAll data is saved locally on your phone in a database, and in the future functionality for cloud storage may become available.
    </string>
    <string name="about_nav_overview_title">Navigation Overview</string>
    <string name="about_nav_overview"><u><b>Current Workout:</b></u> Your currently selected workout. You can mark an exercise as done, update the weight of an exercise, or watch the video associated with it if you have that option enabled.
        When done you can restart the workout and all exercises will be unchecked and you will be brought back to the beginning of the workout. Alternatively, hold down the \"Next\" button to activate a shortcut to restart the workout from any day.
        If enabled in the settings page, a timer or stopwatch is provided. These will run in the background as long as the app is not terminated.
        \n\n<u><b>My Workouts:</b></u> Where all of your workouts are located. The workout at the top is the currently selected one. To switch the current workout, you can select any of your workouts that appear in the list.
        To create new workouts, click the plus button at the bottom of the page. You can rename, edit, reset statistics, or delete the current workout by clicking the three dots next to the current workout.
        \n\n<u><b>My Exercises:</b></u> Exercises, both custom and default, are listed in this section, and the weights and URL associated with the exercises can be modified.
        \n\n<u><b>Settings:</b></u> This section allows for any user settings to be enabled or disabled. These changes will persist upon the closing of the app.

    <string name="default_weight_help_msg">The default weight of this exercise is the weight that will be defaulted to whenever you add this exercise to a new workout or existing one.
        \n\nChanging this value will NOT update any weights in existing workouts. To do that, you would have to edit the workout and edit the specific instances of this exercise with the desired weight.

    <string name="default_sets_reps_help_msg">Reps is short for “repetitions” and is the number of times you complete an exercise in a single cycle. This cycle is called a “set”. The default sets and reps are the values that will be defaulted to whenever you add this exercise to a new workout or existing one.
        \n\nChanging these values will NOT update any sets/reps in existing workouts. To do that, you would have to edit the workout and edit the specific instances of this exercise with the desired sets/reps.
    </string>
    <string name="default_details_help_msg">
        Details are short messages that you can leave for specific exercises to aide in tracking your workouts. Perhaps you may wish to leave a detail that says to only do this exercise with free weights, or only to do this exercise outside. The possibilities are endless.
        \n\nChanging this value will NOT update this exercise\'s details in existing workouts. To do that, you would have to edit the workout and edit the specific instances of this exercise with the desired details.

        LiteWeight is used for creating and tracking custom workouts. The “Current Workout” tab is the tab that contains the workout that you are currently working on. As you cycle through the days you can track which exercises you completed and what weight you used, and then whenever you are ready you can restart the workout to be brought back to day one with all exercises ready to be completed again! After you create a workout you can then share it to any other LiteWeight user.
    </string>
    <string name="restart_workout_explanation">At this time, you are not able to see specifics of workouts that have already been restarted. The only information you can get would be from your statistics of that workout to see what your average completion percentage is of the workout.</string>
    <string name="share_workout_explanation">When you share a workout to another user, it makes a copy of the workout at the time of you sharing it. Thus, any changes you make will not be reflected in the copy you sent them. You must send it again for them to get the updated changes.</string>
    <string name="default_explanation">Whenever you create a new workout or add exercises to an existing workout, the exercises will take the value of the default values specified for that exercise. Changing the values of an exercise, (i.e. weight, sets, reps, details), when they are in a workout will NOT update the default values.\n\nThe only default field that can change from changing it in an existing or new workout is weight. If enabled in your user settings, this default weight will automatically get updated upon saving or restarting a workout whenever the weight in that workout is higher than the current default weight.</string>
