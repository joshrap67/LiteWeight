# LiteWeight Android App

This app is a lightweight workout manager that allows for workouts to be created, managed, and shared. The application interacts with a [.Net Core backend hosted on Google Cloud](api/README.md).

Default exercises are provided for adding to workouts, and any custom exercises can be created if desired. All exercises can have a URL associated with it for viewing a video on how to perform it while working out.

Friend requests can be sent to any other LiteWeight user and workouts can additionally be sent to any user.
